``django-mongodb-cash-backend`` was originally created by Karol Sikora.

The PRIMARY AUTHORS are (and/or have been):

* Karol Sikora <karol.sikora@laboratorium.ee>
* Alireza Savand <alireza.savand@gmail.com>
* François‎

And here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who have submitted patches, reported bugs, added translations, helped
answer newbie questions, and generally made ``python-stop-words`` that much better:

* Alireza Savand <alireza.savand@gmail.com>
* Mike Staszel <crimsonredmk@gmail.com>


A big THANK YOU goes to:

* François‎ for convincing Alireza to start the project.
* Guido van Rossum for creating Python.
